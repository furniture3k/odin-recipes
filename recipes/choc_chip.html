    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz browned butter</li>
        <li>9.75 oz light brown sugar</li>
        <li>4.5 oz granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>11.5 oz all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp hazelnut coffee grounds</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>16 oz inclusions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine the browned butter and sugars in the bowl 
            of a stand mixer. Begin creaming the butter and sugar, 
            using a paddle attachment, at medium-high speed. 
            Continue mixing until the butter becomes soft, aerated, 
            and fully combined with the sugars, about 1-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure the 
            mixture is homogeneous.
        </li>
        <li>
            Start adding the eggs, one at a time, and mixing 
            thoroughly in between additions. Make sure to scrape 
            down the bowl in between additions as well. This will 
            ensure the entire mixture is well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, coffee 
            grounds, baking soda, and baking powder. Whisk to 
            evenly distribute the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the dry ingredients all at once to the mixing bowl, 
            then mix at low speed until the batter is just combined. 
            Overmixing the dough at this stage can result in 
            unwanted gluten development.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine the dough with the inclusions/toppings of your 
            choice. Once again, avoid overmixing the dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using an ice cream scoop, scoop the dough into mounds. 
            Place them evenly on a large, rimmed baking sheet 
            lined with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Refrigerate the dough overnight or up to 3 days. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the cookies at 375Â°F for 18-20 minutes, rotating 
            the pan halfway through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the still hot cookie to a cooling rack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enjoy warm or at room temperature. 
        </li>
    </ol>
