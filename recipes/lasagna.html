    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Brown the beef</strong> - Add oil to a deep
            pan and sautee onion and beef until browned, 5 minutes 
            then add garlic and stir another minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Finish the sauce</strong> - Pour in 1/4 cup
            of wine and stir until almost evaporated. Add marinara, 
            salt, pepper, thyme, sugar, and parsley; bring to a 
            simmer, then cover and cook 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the cheese filling</strong> - Combine all 
            of the cheese sauce ingredients and 1 cup of mozzarella in 
            a mixing bowl (reserve the rest for later).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prep</strong> - Preheat your oven to 375ºF and 
            cook the lasagna noodles in a pot of well-salted water 
            until al dente.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble</strong> - Spread 1/2 cup of the meat 
            sauce on the bottom of a 9×13-inch casserole dish. Add 3 
            noodles, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, 1 cup of 
            mozzarella, and half of the ricotta mixture. Repeat, 
            then for the top layer, add 3 noodles, 1/3 of the meat 
            sauce, and the remaining mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake</strong> - Cover with foil and bake at 
            375˚F for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and broil for 
            3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rest</strong> - Let the lasagna rest for about 
            30 minutes before cutting and serving.
