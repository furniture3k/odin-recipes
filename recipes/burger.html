    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Who doesn’t love a juicy chargrilled beef burger loaded with melted cheese, tangy pickles and fresh crispy vegetables? I know my family does, which is why I often find myself making these insanely melt-in-the-mouth burgers on the regular. They are so easy to make and super low-cost and only require one pan (or a barbecue!) and 22 minutes – brilliant! I sometimes hide extra chopped veggies in the burgers to up the nutrition factor, and using breadcrumbs in the mix ensures the patties are impossible to dry out or get wrong. I often make more patties than I need as they are freezer-friendly and also make great lunchbox fillers.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g beef mince</li>
        <li>30g panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <il>1 egg</il>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp sea salt flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <il>1-2 tbsp water</il>
        <il>4 brioche rolls, halved and toasted</il>
        <il>4 slices of gouda cheese</il>
        <il>2 sliced tomatoes</il>
        <il>1 sliced red onion</il>
        <il>8 leaves of lettuce</il>
        <il>2 tbsp sliced gherkins</il>
        <il>4 tsp mayonnaise</il>
        <il>4 teaspoons tomato sauce</il>
        <il>4 teaspoons mustard</il>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the burger patties - To a large bowl, add the beef mince, breadcrumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, salt and pepper. Use your hands to combine well. Divide the mixture into 4-6 portions, then use your hands to form patties. Their size ideally needs to be just bigger than the burger buns you are using as the patties will shrink slightly as they cook.</li>
        <li>Use your thumb to make an indent in one side of the patty. This helps the patties keep their shape during cooking.</li>
        <li>Cook the burger patties - Heat the olive oil in a heavy-based frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook the burger patties for 10-12 minutes, turning once halfway through. Add the water to the pan in the last 2 minutes of cooking. This step is optional, it allows you to scrape up all of the delicious sticky bits in the base of the pan and they cling to the outside of the patties = more flavour! For a delicious chargrilled result, you can cook the patties in a chargrill pan or cook them on a barbecue plate. Heat the plate to medium-high, spray the plate with oil just before cooking and cook the patties for 10-12 minutes, turning once halfway. </li>
        <li>Assemble and serve - Serve the brioche buns topped with burger patties, cheese, tomato, red onion, gherkins, lettuce, whole-egg mayonnaise, ketchup and American mustard. Serve immediately!</li>
