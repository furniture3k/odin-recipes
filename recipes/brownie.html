    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Savor the irresistible allure of delicious brownies—each 
        bite a symphony of fudgy decadence. These moist, 
        chocolatey treats boast a perfect balance of rich cocoa, 
        velvety butter, and just the right amount of sweetness. 
        Whether warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or paired 
        with a steaming cup of coffee, each square is a blissful 
        indulgence in every bite.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking 
            dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) 
            with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. 
            Spray the parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, 
            powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, 
            water, and vanilla.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until 
            just combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick 
            - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake 
            for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out 
            with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to 
            pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too 
            long). Cool completely before slicing. Store in an 
            airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 
            days. These also freeze well!
        </li>
    </ol>
